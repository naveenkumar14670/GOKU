  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p title="1st paragraph">
    My hero is a Son Goku, a mythical character in the hit TV show series Dragonball Z.
    Dragonball Z is a continuation of Dragonball, Goku adventures as a child, and prelude to Dragonball GT, the story of Gokuâ€™s granddaughter Pan and her friend Trunks.
    I chose Goku because of his strong moral compass and his carefree demeanor.
  </p>
  <p title="2nd paragraph">
    Goku is an iconic symbol of Good against Evil, the main theme in his story.
    He has fought a great deal of battles with a great number of villains.
    Some of his most famous battles include; Goku vs.
    Frieza, Goku and his friends against Cell, and Goku vs. Majin Buu.
    In all three battles Goku is protecting Earth against a very powerful enemy with heavy tolls to his personal health.
    In total Goku has died three times in three different battles defending Earth and his friends.
    He is very brave and always puts others in front of himself with a happy-go-lucky smile.
  </p>
  <p title="3rd paragraph">
    Goku is my hero because of his strong moral ideals; this made a big impression on my childhood.
    Dragonball Z was of the only shows I watched as a child; I loved coming back each week to see what new adventure Goku had gotten himself into.
    I feel this instilled me with very strong moral values and livened up my childhood.
    I also met my childhood best friend through Dragonball Z, which we both were deeply interested.
    He is still my hero and will always be for more reasons then I can name in this essay.
